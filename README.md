OmniCalc: The Tkinter Scientific Calculator 🚀A sleek, feature-rich scientific calculator built with Python 3 and the standard Tkinter framework. Designed with a modern, responsive dark-mode UI, OmniCalc is a powerful yet intuitive tool perfect for students, engineers, and professionals requiring advanced calculation capabilities.✨ Features at a GlanceOmniCalc provides a comprehensive set of functions while prioritizing user experience and security.🔬 Scientific & Advanced MathematicsCategoryFunctionsBasic ArithmeticAddition ($+$), Subtraction ($-$), Multiplication ($\times$), Division ($\div$)Powers & Roots$x^y$, $x^2$, $x^3$, $\sqrt{x}$, $\sqrt[3]{x}$, $e^x$Trigonometry$\sin$, $\cos$, $\tan$, and their Inverse ($\sin^{-1}, \cos^{-1}, \tan^{-1}$) and Hyperbolic ($\sinh, \cosh, \tanh$) counterparts.Logarithms$\log_{10}$, $\ln$ (Natural Logarithm)Constants$\pi$, $e$UtilityFactorial ($x!$), Percentage ($\%$), and an ANS key to recall the last result.🧠 Memory ManagementFull memory functionality including:MC (Memory Clear)MR (Memory Recall)M+ (Memory Add)M- (Memory Subtract)🎨 Modern UI/UX & WorkflowDark Mode Theme: Visually appealing, professional, and easy on the eyes.Multi-Line Display: Clearly separates the current expression from the final, evaluated result.Responsive Layout: Adapts dynamically to window resizing, ensuring usability on various screen sizes.Full Keyboard Support: Dedicated keyboard bindings for a faster, professional workflow.🛡️ Secure EvaluationCalculations are performed using a restricted eval() method paired with a carefully curated dictionary of safe mathematical functions (math module). This approach prevents the execution of malicious code, enhancing application security.💻 Technologies & ArchitectureStackLanguage: Python 3GUI Framework: Tkinter (Standard Library)Core Modules: math, re (Regular Expressions)Code OverviewThe architecture is designed for clarity, maintainability, and extensibility, encapsulated within the ScientificCalculator class.ComponentResponsibilityKey Design FeatureStyle ClassCentralizes all application constants (colors, fonts, padding).Facilitates rapid theme switching and styling consistency.UI CreationDefines the layout of the display and all button elements.Uses a single, declarative list of dictionaries (_get_button_definitions) for easy layout modification.Core LogicHandles input processing, DEG/RAD mode conversion, and evaluation._preprocess_expression() intelligently manages mode conversions. evaluate() ensures security via restricted function access.FunctionalityImplements utility features like memory and mode toggles.toggle_second_mode() dynamically changes button commands and labels, effectively doubling the functionality without duplicating UI elements.🛠️ Getting StartedPrerequisitesEnsure you have Python 3 installed. Tkinter is included by default with most Python distributions, so no external packages are required.Installation and ExecutionClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/ankitscse27/-OmniCalc-The-Tkinter-Scientific-Calculator.git
Navigate to the project directory:Bashcd OmniCalc-The-Tkinter-Scientific-Calculator
Run the script:Bashpython main.py
The calculator window will launch immediately.⌨️ Keyboard ShortcutsMaximize your productivity with a complete set of keyboard bindings:Key(s)Action0-9, .Enter number and decimal+, -, /, *Basic arithmetic operators(, )Add parenthesesEnter / ReturnCalculate the result (=)BackspaceDelete the last characterEscapeClear the entire input (C)🤝 Contribution & LicenseContributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome!
